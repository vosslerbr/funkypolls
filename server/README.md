# Example Server

Example description...

## Installation

1. You need Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone <repository_link>
```

3. Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Usage

There are four scripts that you can run:

1. To start the server, use the following command:

```
npm run start
```

2. To start the server in development mode, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

3. To compile TypeScript to JavaScript, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```



Remember that for the 'start' script to run, you need to first compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript using the 'build' script.


## Project Structure

The project has a modular structure that separates different concerns into different directories:

- `controllers`: This directory contains controller files. Controllers are responsible for defining application logic. They interact with models to retrieve data, apply the necessary transformations, and send the data to views for presentation. Each file typically represents a controller for a specific entity in your application.

- `middleware`: This directory holds middleware functions. Middleware are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They can execute any code, make changes to the request and the response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware in the stack. Additionally, this directory contains an index.ts file which exports all the middleware functions. This file serves as a central point for importing middleware, and the functions it exports are typically used in the main server file where the middleware functions are called to run before the routes.

- `routes`: This directory is responsible for defining the application's routes. Routes determine how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

  - `v1`: This sub-directory within the 'routes' directory contains all the routes for version 1 of your API. It's a common practice to version your API, especially when you are planning for future changes that might break compatibility with clients using an older version of your API.
